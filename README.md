In the folder you can find different datasets, jupyter notebook & trained model
Entire code (training & Evaluation) is there in a single jupyter notebook.
This is the final version of model.
Before this I have also done some other assignment related to this RL trader only, in which I built trading environment etc. Some of these are present in our group github repo.
